Definition of Business Intelligence (BI)

According to [[https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/business-intelligence-bi/][Gartner]], BI is defined as:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A broad category of applications and technologies for gathering,
storing, analyzing, sharing and providing access to data to help
enterprise users make better business decisions.
#+END_QUOTE

[[https://www.edx.org/bio/peter-myers][Peter Myers]] simplifies it as:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It transforms data into knowledge to support decisions. 
#+END_QUOTE

BI is used by decision makers to:
 - Understand the health of the organization.
 - Collaborate on a shared view of:
   * Data,
   * Business logic, and
   * Business drivers.
 - Reduce the time to decision.

Its goal is often to:
 - Impact the bottom line by measuring specific operations.
 - Enhance competitive advantage.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
BI is no longer a luxury afforded by a larger companies---it is
considered an essential part of the IT portfolio.
#+END_QUOTE

It encompasses a broad spectrum of technologies and requires skilled
professionals to design, develop and manage.

Common questions addressed by BI.
 * What sales have been made, and where?
 * How are the salespeople performing?
 * Which customers are likely to buy from us?
 * Which products do our customers buy together?
 * What is the customer sentiment of our new product?

Organizations have large volumes of related data stored in a variety
of data systems, often in different formats, and possibly residing in
different locations (on-premises, or cloud)

Data systems may not:
 - Be easily queried.
 - Be optimized for analytical queries.
 - Contain all the data required, by design, or in history.
 - Manage historical context.
 - Be available or accessible.

Employees may not have sufficient skills, tools, or permissions to
query data systems.
 - Commonly, employees do not have access to operational data systems,
   due to valid concerns that analytic queries can negatively impact
   on performance.

Systems may not have consistent definitions.

Decision makers need:
 - Data catalogs to discover and understand data assets.
 - Reliable, secure access to data.
 - Flexibility in the ways they access data
 - Low latency query results
 - Tools and training
   * View and interact with data assets and reports
   * Produce their own data models, reports, and dashboards (Self-Service BI)
