**** Data and Variables
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: data-and-variables
     :END:
*Data* are pieces of information about individuals organized into
variables.  By an *individual*, we mean a particular person or object.
By a *variable*, we mean a particular characteristic of the individual.

A *dataset* is a set of data identified with particular circumstances.
Datasets are typically displayed in tables, in which rows represent
individuals and columns represent variables.

[[file:eda_examining_distributions_variables.png]]

Variables can be classified into one of two types: categorical or quantitative.
 * *Categorical variables* take category or label values and place an
   individual into one of several groups.  Each observation can be
   placed in only one category, and the categories are mutually
   exclusive.
 * *Quantitative variables* take numerical values and represent some
   kind of measurement.

Note: Categorical variables are sometimes called qualitative
variables, but in this course we use the term categorical.

**** Scale of Measurement
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: scale-of-measurement
     :END:
Previously, a simple distinction was made between quantitative and
categorical variables.  However, there is a more precise method of
categorizing variables: it is called *scale of measurement*.  The four
different scales of measurement, from least to most precise, are
 * Nominal
 * Ordinal
 * Interval
 * Ratio

Nominal Variables
 * It only indicates differences and uses discrete categories to
   describe qualitative differences.
 * Examples
   * Types of pets (birds, fish, cats, dogs)
   * Gender (male, female, transgender)
   * Eye color (blue, green, brown, hazel)
   * Type of house (bungalow, duplex, ranch)
   * Type of resident (homeowner, renter)

Ordinal Variables
 * It is more precise than nominal data as the differences can now be
   rank-orders.  However, it does not indicate the difference between
   two numbers are fixed or equal.
 * An /ordinal/ variable is a categorical variable for which the
   possible values are ordered.  Ordinal variables can be
   considered "in between" categorical and quantitative variables.
 * Examples
   * Order of finishes in a race
   * Educational level:
     1. Elementary school education
     2. High school graduate
     3. Some college
     4. College graduate
     5. Graduate degree
   * Survey question responses: "My general health is ..."
     1. Poor
     2. Reasonable
     3. Good
     4. Excellent

Interval Variables
 * It takes numerical forms and the distance between pairs of
   consecutive numbers is assumed to be equal.
 * However, interval variables do not have a meaningful zero point.
 * Examples
   * Temperature in Celsius
   * IQ scores
   * SAT scores

Ratio Variables
 * It is like the interval data plus a meaningful zero point.
 * Examples
   * Age
   * Height
   * Weight
   * Cost of a car, in dollars

More precise level of measurement can be converted to a less precise
level of measurement.

Age in years is a ratio variable and can be scaled into an ordinal
variable of age groups, which can include toddler, adolescent, young
adulthood, and middle age.

Less precise data cannot be made into more precise data.

In order to convert these raw data into useful information we need to
summarize and then examine the *distribution* of the variable.  By
*distribution* of a variable, we mean:
 * what values the variables takes, and
 * how often the variable takes those values.

a graphical display. There are two simple graphical displays for
visualizing the distribution of categorical data:

*** DONE One Quantitative Variable: Graphs
    CLOSED: [2018-01-19 Fri 10:03]
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: one-quantitative-variable-graphs
    :END:
To display data from one quantitative variable graphically, we can use
either the *histogram* or the *stemplot*.  (Another graph, the *boxplot*,
will be covered in another section).

**** Histogram: Intervals
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: histogram-intervals
     :END:
Break the range of values into intervals and count how many
observations fall into each interval.

Here are the exam grades of 15 students:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
88, 48, 60, 51, 57, 85, 69, 75, 97, 72, 71, 79, 65, 63, 73
#+END_EXAMPLE

We first need to break the range of values into intervals (also called
"bins" or "classes").  In this case, since our dataset consists of
exam scores, it will make sense to choose intervals that typically
correspond to the range of a letter grade, 10 points wide: 40-50,
50-60, ..., 90-100.  By counting how many of the 15 observations fall
in each of the intervals, we get the following table:

#+CAPTION: Exam Grades
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 200px
| Score    | Count |
|----------+-------|
| [40-50)  |     1 |
| [50-60)  |     2 |
| [60-70)  |     4 |
| [70-80)  |     5 |
| [80-90)  |     2 |
| [90-100] |     1 |

To construct the histogram from this table we plot the intervals on
the X-axis, and show the number of observations in each interval
(frequency of the interval) on the Y-axis, which is represented by the
height of a rectangle located above the interval:
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 690px
[[file:hist-exam-grades.png]]

The table above can also be turned into a relative frequency table.

#+CAPTION: Exam Grades with relative frequency
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 380px
| Score    | Count | Relative Frequency |
|----------+-------+--------------------|
| [40-50)  |     1 |               0.07 |
| [50-60)  |     2 |               0.13 |
| [60-70)  |     4 |               0.27 |
| [70-80)  |     5 |               0.33 |
| [80-90)  |     2 |               0.13 |
| [90-100] |     1 |               0.07 |
| Total    |    15 |                    |

A relative frequency table, like the one above, can be used to
determine the frequency of scores occurring at or across intervals.

**** Histogram: Shape
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: histogram-shape
     :END:

Once the distribution has been displayed graphically, we can describe
the overall pattern of the distribution and mention any striking
deviations from that pattern.  More specifically, we should consider
the following features of the distribution:
 * Overall pattern
   * Shape
   * Center
   * Spread
 * deviations from the pattern
   * Outliers

When describing the shape of a distribution, we should consider:
 1. *Symmetry/skewness* of the distribution.
 2. *Peakedness (modality)*---the number of peaks (modes) the distribution has.

We distinguish between:
 * Symmetric distributions

   [[file:symmetric-unimodal.gif]]

   [[file:symmetric-bimodal.gif]]

   [[file:symmetric-uniform.gif]]

   Note that all three distributions are symmetric, but are different
   in their modality (peakedness).  The first distribution is
   *unimodal*---it has one mode (roughly at 10) around which the
   observations are concentrated.  The second distribution is
   *bimodal*---it has two modes (roughly at 10 and 20) around which
   the observations are concentrated.  The third distribution is kind
   of flat, or uniform.  The distribution has no modes, or no value
   around which the observations are concentrated.  Rather, we see
   that the observations are roughly uniformly distributed among the
   different values.

 * Skewed right distributions

   [[file:skewed-right.gif]]

   A distribution is called *skewed right* if, as in the histogram
   above, the right tail (larger values) is much longer than the left
   tail (small values).  Note that in a skewed right distribution, the
   bulk of the observations are small/medium, with a few observations
   that are much larger than the rest.  An example of a real-life
   variable that has a skewed right distribution is salary.  Most
   people earn in the low/medium range of salaries, with a few
   exceptions (CEOs, professional athletes etc.) that are distributed
   along a large range (long "tail") of higher values.

 * Skewed left distributions

   [[file:skewed-left.gif]]

   A distribution is called *skewed left* if, as in the histogram above,
   the left tail (smaller values) is much longer than the right tail
   (larger values).  Note that in a skewed left distribution, the bulk
   of the observations are medium/large, with a few observations that
   are much smaller than the rest.  An example of a real life variable
   that has a skewed left distribution is age of death from natural
   causes (heart disease, cancer etc.).  Most such deaths happen at
   older ages, with fewer cases happening at younger ages.

Comments:
 1. Note that skewed distributions can also be bimodal.  Here is an
    example.  A medium size neighborhood 24-hour convenience store
    collected data from 537 customers on the amount of money spend in
    a single visit to the store.  The following histogram displays the
    data.

    [[file:skewed-right-bimodal.png]]

    Note that the overall shape of the distribution is skewed to the
    right with a clear mode around $25.  In addition it has another
    (smaller) “peak” (mode) around $50-55.  The majority of the
    customers spend around $25 but there is a cluster of customers who
    enter the store and spend around $50-55.

 2. If a distribution has more than two modes, we say that the
    distribution is *multimodal*.

The distribution for exam grades is roughly symmetric.

**** Histogram: Center, Spread, & Outliers
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: histogram-center-spread-outliers
     :END:

Center
 * The center of the distribution is its *midpoint*---the value that
   divides the distribution so that approximately half the
   observations take smaller values, and approximately half the
   observations take larger values.  Note that from looking at the
   histogram we can get only a rough estimate for the center of the
   distribution.

Spread
 * The *spread* (also called *variability*) of the distribution can be
   described by the approximate range covered by the data.  From
   looking at the histogram, we can approximate the smallest
   observation (*min*), and the largest observation (*max*), and thus
   approximate the range.

Outliers
 * *Outliers* are observations that fall outside the overall pattern.
   For example, the following histogram represents a distribution that
   has a high probable outlier:

   [[file:outlier.gif]]

**** Stemplot
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: stemplot
     :END:
The stemplot (also called stem and leaf plot) is another graphical
display of the distribution of quantitative data.

Separate each data point into a stem and leaf, as follows:
 * The leaf is the right-most digit.
 * The stem is everything except the right-most digit.
 * So, if the data point is 34, then 3 is the stem and 4 is the leaf.
 * If the data point is 3.41, then 3.4 is the stem and 1 is the leaf.

To make a stemplot:
 1. Separate each observation into a stem and a leaf.
 2. Write the stems in a vertical column with the smallest at the top,
    and draw a vertical line at the right of this column.
 3. Go through the data points, and write each leaf in the row to the
    right of its stem.
 4. Rearrange the leaves in an increasing order.

When some of the stems hold a large number of leaves, we can split
each stem into two: one holding the leaves 0-4, and the other holding
the leaves 5-9. A statistical software package will often do the
splitting for you, when appropriate.

#+end_example

Note that when rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, the stemplot
visually resembles a histogram.

This orientation makes the right-skewness of the distribution
clearly visible.

The stemplot has additional unique features:
 * It preserves the original data.
 * It sorts the data (which will become very useful in the next
   section).


Dotplot
 * There is another type of display that we can use to summarize a
   quantitative variable graphically—the dotplot. The dotplot, like
   the stemplot, shows each observation, but displays it with a dot
   rather than with its actual value. Here is the dotplot for the ages
   of Best Actress Oscar winners.

*** DONE One Quantitative Variable: Measures of Center
    CLOSED: [2018-01-19 Fri 16:56]
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: one-quantitative-variable-measures-of-center
    :END:
The three main numerical measures for the center of a distribution are
the *mode*, the *mean* and the *median*.  Each one of these measures
is based on a completely different idea of describing the center of a
distribution. We will first present each one of the measures, and then
compare their properties.

**** Mode
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: mode
     :END:
So far, when we looked at the shape of the distribution, we identified
the mode as the value where the distribution has a “peak” and saw
examples when distributions have one mode (unimodal distributions) or
two modes (bimodal distributions).  In other words, so far we
identified the mode visually from the histogram.

Technically, the mode is the most commonly occurring value in a
distribution.  For simple datasets where the frequency of each value
is available or easily determined, the value that occurs with the
highest frequency is the mode.

**** Mean
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: mean
     :END:
The mean is the average of a set of observations (i.e., the sum of the
observations divided by the number of observations).  If the n
observations are $x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n$, their mean, which we denote
by $\bar{x}$, is therefore $\bar{x} = (x_1 + x_2 + \dotsb + x_n) /
n$.

**** Median
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: median
     :END:
The median $M$ is the midpoint of the distribution.  It is the number
such that half of the observations fall above, and half fall below.
To find the median:
 * Order the data from smallest to largest.
 * Consider whether $n$, the number of observations, is even or odd.
   * If $n$ is *odd*, the median $M$ is the center observation in the
     ordered list.  This observation is the one "sitting" in the
     $(n + 1) / 2$ spot in the ordered list.
   * If $n$ is *even*, the median $M$ is the *mean* of the *two center
     observations* in the ordered list.  These two observations are the
     ones "sitting" in the $n / 2$ and $n / 2 + 1$ spots in the ordered
     list.

**** Comparing Mean and Median
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: comparing-mean-and-median
     :END:
As we have seen, mean and the median, two of the common measures of
center, each describe the center of a distribution of values in a
different way.  The mean describes the center as an average value, in
which the /actual values/ of the data points play an important role.
The median, on the other hand, locates the middle value as the center,
and the /order/ of the data is the key to finding it.

*The mean is very sensitive to outliers (because it factors in their
magnitude), while the median is resistant to outliers.*

 - For symmetric distributions with no outliers: $\bar{x}$ is approximately
   equal to $M$.

 - For skewed right distributions and/or datasets with high outliers,
   $\bar{x} &gt; M$.

 - For skewed left distributions and/or datasets with low outliers,
   $\bar{x} &lt; M$.

We will therefore use $\bar{x}$ as a measure of center for symmetric
distributions with no outliers.  Otherwise, the median will be a more
appropriate measure of the center of our data.

A description of a distribution almost always includes a measure of
its center or average.  The two common measures of center are the *mean*
and the *median*.
