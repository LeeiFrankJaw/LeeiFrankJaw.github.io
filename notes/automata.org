* IN-PROGRESS Week 1: [[https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:ComputerScience+Automata+SelfPaced/courseware/544b7a8df3844f428bc1a5125c594702/ec6439250bb4426ab93c543e140dacb4/][Finite Automata]]

Automata is ranked second after database for optional courses in a
Stanford survey of grads 5 years out.  3X the score for AI.

  * Regular expressions are used in many systems.
    - UNIX a.*b.
    - DTD describe XML tags with a RE format like
      ~person(name, addr, child*)~.
  * Finite automata model protocols, electronic circuits.
  * Context-free grammars are used to describe the syntax of
    essentially every programming language.
    - Not to forget their important role in describing natural
      languages.
  * And DTD taken as a whole, are really CFGs.
  * When developing solutions to real problems, we often confront the
    limitations of what software can do.
    - /Undecidable/ things - no program whatever can do it.
    - /Intractable/ things - there are programs, but no fast programs.
  * Automata theory gives you the tools.

Other Good Stuff

  * We'll learn how to deal formally with discrete systems.
    - Proofs: You never really prove a program correct, but you need
      to be thinking of why a tricky technique really works.
  * We'll gain experience with abstract models and constructions.
    - Models layered software architectures.

Course Outline

  * Regular Languages and their descriptors:
    - Finite automata, nondeterministic finite automata, regular
      expressions.
    - Algorithms to decide questions about regular languages, e.g., is
      it empty?
    - Closure properties of regular languages.
  * Context-free languages and their descriptors:
    - Context-free grammars, pushdown automata.
    - Decision and closure properties.
  * Recursive and recursively enumerable languages.
    - Turing machines, decidability of problems.
    - The limit of what can be computed.
  * Intractable problems.
    - Problems that (appear to) require exponential time.
    - NP-completeness and beyound.

What is a Finite Automaton?

  * A formal system.
  * Remembers only a finite amount of information.
  * Information represented by its /state/.
  * State changes in response to /inputs/.
  * Rules that tell how the state changes in response to inputs are
    called /transitions/.


Tennis

  * /Match/ = 3-5 sets.
  * /Set/ = 6 or more games.

Scoring a Game

  * One person serves throughout.
  * To win, you must score at least 4 points.
  * You also must win by at least 2 points.
  * Inputs are s = "server wins point" and o = "opponent wins point."
