At my previous company, we have a server in the office and it is
behind LAN.  My boss at the time wanted to ssh to this server at
home.  To solve the problem, we need a third server.

Let the server in the office be A, my boss's laptop at home be B, and
the third server be C.  This third server C must be accessible by both
A and B.  Suppose C is at domain ~example.com~ with a user ~C~ and B
has a user named ~B~.

On server B, do the following to create a reverse tunnel from C to B.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ssh -f -N -T -R 22222:localhost:22 C@example.com
#+END_SRC

Then, on machine A, do the following to access server B via server C.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ssh -t C@example.com ssh -p 22222 B@localhost
#+END_SRC
